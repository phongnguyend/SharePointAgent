# SharePoint Agent

A React front end for `SharePointAgent.Api`. It shows the worker's SQL Server state — the
`SharePointIndexedFiles` and `SharePointDeltaState` tables — and runs the three retrieval strategies
against the search index, side by side.

## Pages

The **Token usage** page also includes a **Content Safety** tab for requests, outcomes, daily totals, estimated text records, and per-request scores/attribution. Configure the backend's `ContentSafety` section to enable checks of user messages, assistant responses, and extracted attachment text. Enabled checks buffer assistant output until approved.

| Page | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Token usage** | Two report tabs: **Token Usage** for chat input/output/total tokens, turns, per-turn averages, daily trends, model/user breakdowns and a paginated turn log; **Embedding Usage** for indexing/search tokens, activities and attribution. Both support filters and detail popups. Available to Global Admin and Global Reader Admin. |
| **Overview** | Totals over the indexed-file table: files, chunks, source size, drives, files outside the current reconciliation round, and how many distinct index fingerprints are in play. Plus files by content type, the most recently indexed files, and the delta checkpoints. |
| **Indexed files** | The `SharePointIndexedFiles` table, filterable and sortable, with per-file embedding token usage and a Reindex action on each row. Select a row to see every recorded column — ETag, CTag, permissions hash, index fingerprint, scan ID, and the drive and item IDs. |
| **Attachment files** | Chat attachment files with conversion/index status, conversation links, chunk counts, embedding token usage, errors, download, reindex, and orphan deletion actions. |
| **Delta state** | The `SharePointDeltaState` table, one card per drive: the scan ID, sweep status, timestamp, and delta link. Reset clears a drive's cursor while retaining its row; Delete removes the row. Either action starts a full drive scan on the next sync. |
| **Subscriptions** | The Microsoft Graph webhook subscriptions on the application registration. Shows each tracked subscription's auto-renew setting and whether its resource, notification URL, and client state match this deployment. Create, edit, renew, enable or disable auto-renew, and delete; deleting takes two clicks. The **Default** record has a fixed URL and cannot be deleted. Any other subscription can be edited freely as long as its notification URL is not already taken. |
| **Chat** | Conversations with an agent that searches the index when a question needs it. Attach up to ten files, create or delete chats, and read Markdown answers with a collapsible list of sources. Conversations name themselves from the first question and are stored in SQL Server, so they survive a restart. |
| **Feedback** | Every answer someone rated in the chat: the question, the answer, its sources, and a link that opens that conversation. Filter by rating or by text; tiles show how many were liked, disliked, and the liked share. The link jumps straight to that answer in the thread and highlights it, which matters once a conversation is long. |
| **Search** | Full-text, vector, and hybrid over the same request body. **Compare all three** issues them together and reports each one's round trip, plus how much the three agree — distinct chunks returned, how many every strategy found, and how many only one strategy found. |

The Indexed files and Attachment files lists both offer **View Markdown**. The API converts the source file with MarkItDown when opened; the resizable popup shows plain text and rendered Markdown tabs.

Searches are kept in the URL (`/search?q=…&mode=compare&top=10`), so a result is a link and the
back button steps through searches. So is the open conversation
(`/chat?conversation=…&message=…`), which is how the Feedback page links to a particular answer.

## Running it

Configure [Entra ID sign-in](../README.md#entra-id-sign-in) on the existing SharePoint app registration first. The frontend reads the tenant/client IDs from `/api/auth/config`; no client secret belongs in frontend configuration. Register `http://localhost:5173/auth-redirect.html` as a **Single-page application** redirect URI and expose the delegated `api://<ClientId>/access_as_user` scope with v2 access tokens.

The backend also requires **Microsoft Graph → Application permissions → `User.Read.All`** with **admin consent** to verify the user's directory email and link their application account. After granting consent, restart the API before retrying sign-in. If the UI shows **Cannot verify the user with Microsoft Graph**, follow the [service permission setup and troubleshooting](../README.md#application-service-permissions). Application roles such as Global Admin do not grant Graph permissions.

The app shows **Sign in with your organization** before loading its pages. The account and **Sign out** appear in the header. API calls, including streaming chat and attachment downloads, carry access tokens acquired by MSAL. Deploy the generated `auth-redirect.html` alongside `index.html`; do not rewrite that file to the React entry point.

DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX files can be opened in the app from Search results, the Indexed files detail panel,
the Attachment files page, or a chat message attachment. The preview downloads the file bytes to the browser
and offers a save button. Indexed-file previews fetch the current SharePoint version and are limited by
`Downloads:MaxFileBytes` (20 MB by default). XLSX sheets show 50 rows and 26 columns at a time, with
tabs to select worksheets and controls to move through larger sheets. The grid displays common cell
formatting, number formats, column widths, row heights, and merged cells.

The API must be running first. From `backend/SharePointAgent.Api`:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Then here:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. The dev server proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:5263`, so the browser
makes same-origin requests and never needs the API's CORS policy.

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to change either of:

- `VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET` — where `npm run dev` proxies `/api`. Set it when the API is not on 5263;
  the `https` launch profile, for example, is `https://localhost:7104`.
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` — only for a production build served from a different origin than the API. When
  set, add that origin to `Cors:AllowedOrigins` in the API's configuration.

### Other scripts

Deploy with [release.yml](../.github/workflows/release.yml), which builds the frontend with the deployed API URL and uploads `dist/` to Azure Static Web Apps. Configure the environment's deployment token, frontend origin and Entra SPA redirect URI as described in the [release setup](../infra/README.md#github-actions-deployment). The build includes SPA navigation fallback configuration and `auth-redirect.html`.

```bash
npm run build      # typecheck, then build to dist/
npm run preview    # serve the built output
npm run typecheck
```

## What it needs from the API

Index state endpoints added alongside the existing search ones:

- `GET /api/state/summary`
- `GET /api/state/indexed-files?search=&driveId=&sort=&desc=&skip=&top=`
- `GET /api/state/indexed-files/{driveId}/{itemId}`
- `POST /api/state/indexed-files/{driveId}/{itemId}/reindex`
- `GET /api/state/indexed-files/{driveId}/{itemId}/content` (current Office bytes from SharePoint)
- `GET /api/state/delta`

These GET endpoints read the database at `SqlServer:ConnectionString` and never write to it. The content endpoint also
reads the configured SharePoint library through Microsoft Graph. A table that does not
exist yet reads as empty, so the viewer works before the worker's first pass.

The Delta state page also uses `POST /api/state/delta/{driveId}/reset` and
`DELETE /api/state/delta/{driveId}`. Both write to the checkpoint table after confirmation.

The Chat page uses, and these **write to the database and call Azure OpenAI**:

- `GET|POST /api/chat/conversations`, `DELETE /api/chat/conversations/{id}`
- `GET|POST /api/chat/conversations/{id}/messages`
- `POST /api/chat/messages/{id}/feedback` and `GET /api/chat/feedback`
- `POST|GET /api/attachment-files`, `GET /api/attachment-files/{id}/download`, `POST /api/attachment-files/{id}/reindex`, and orphan-only `DELETE /api/attachment-files/{id}`

The Subscriptions page additionally uses, and these **change tenant state**:

- `GET /api/subscriptions`
- `POST /api/subscriptions` — body may include `name`, `days`, `notificationUrl`, and `clientState`
- `PUT /api/subscriptions/{id}` — a changed name, URL, or client state replaces the subscription
- `POST /api/subscriptions/{id}/renew` — optional body `{ "days": 28 }`
- `DELETE /api/subscriptions/{id}` — refused for the default subscription

**These endpoints require Entra sign-in and provide shared operator access.** Assign only trusted operators to the enterprise application: indexed files, conversations, uploads, and subscription administration are not isolated per signed-in user. Health checks, public sign-in configuration, and the validated Graph webhook are the only anonymous API endpoints.
