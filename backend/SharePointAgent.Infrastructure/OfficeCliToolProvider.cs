/// The officecli MCP server, as tools the chat agent can call. officecli works on files that are already

/// local path, and these tools read and edit the .docx, .xlsx, or .pptx file at it.
/// <para>
/// The server is a child process speaking MCP over stdio. It is started by the first turn that asks for
/// its tools and then shared by every turn after, because starting a process per turn would add its
/// startup to every answer. A server that cannot be started is logged once and the agent runs with its
/// own two tools alone, so a broken or missing officecli installation costs one turn rather than every
/// turn; the next attempt is after a restart.
